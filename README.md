Group Questions:

Which Country has the highest level of energy consumption and Greenhouse Emissions?
Do Forms of energy consumption have a direct effect on greenhouse gas emissions in countries?
Does size of population have an effect on the output of greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption in general?
Fom data sets provided by the U.S Energy Information Administration: Opendata - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). We will look for any trends in greenhouse emissions that coincide with yearly values of energy consumption.

Project Data Collection:

We will be utilizing Jupyter and VS code along with mods to isolate particular countries of interest which seems relevant to our questions posted. We will be importing data from Pandas library in order to isolate and organzie particular data that we intend to find. Such as; Country, Greenhouse Emissions, Fossil fuel Consumption, and Electricity Genereation.









Analysis Group 4/Key points:
-From the data provided,  China produces the largest amount of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.The data also shows us that China has the largest energy consumption out of any other country. 

-We can conclude from the data provided  that  energy consumption also results C02 emissions in the atmosphere.


-Despite its increase in consumption of all forms of energy, data provided shows a gradual decrease in overall greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Records for other Countries such as China have shown a gradual increase in all categories of energy and greenhouse gas emissions. 

-Brazil has a similar yearly out put like the US. Greenhouse gas emissions are on a gradual decrease despite the increasing consumption of fossil fuel energy.

-Data provided would suggest that any form of energy consumption, especially fossil fuel consumption, influences greenhouse gas emissions in any country.
-Smaller countries or territories that have an overall smaller energy consumption output, such as the Bahamas, have a significantly smaller, or completely unrecorded number of emissions recorded.

-The United States hit an all-time low in all forms of energy consumption in 2020. COVID 19 epidemic.


Sanja:
•Filtered dataset to indude only the top 1,000 mest populated cities. Queried Operilite Por patlution levels in each city. Handled missing values, enouring data consistency, Standardised measurement units for pollutants.
•Merged dity population data with pollution data. Visualizations Our project indudes several key visualizations 
1. Scatter plats showing the population vs. each pollutant. Scatter Plots
2. Heatmaps showing regional pollution levels. Heatmaps
3. 5. Bar Charte showing the top 10 mod/least polluted cities per pollutant Bar Charts
4. Open Street Map showing the top 1000 populated cities and their pollution levels. Open Street Map 5. Correlation Matris showing how each pollutant is related (or not) against another. Correlation Matrix
5. Powerpoint Presentation Powerpoint Correlation Analysis We computed correlation coefficients (R values) to assess relationships between population and pollutants: Pollutant R-Squared Value Interpretation 50 0.16 Weak correlation NO 0.21 Weak correlation PM10 0.12 Very weak correlation PM2.5 01 0.14 Very weak correlation 0.09 No significant correlation CO 0.10 Very weak correlation Key Findings:
   • We expected higher population to result in higher pollution but found ne strong correlation. • Pollution levels may be more influenced by other factors rather than population size. PM2.5 and PM10 showed the strongest correlation, as expected, due to their similar sources. Al and Achnad on inuarea porrelation se avnartart due to their similar en
